By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

When you create an account, we may collect:
- **Email Address:** To identify your account and secure your data.
- **Business Data:** Information you input into the app (e.g., product names, customer names, phone numbers, sales records, personnel details). This data is stored securely in our database to synchronize across your devices.

### B. Device and Usage Data
We may collect minimal device information primarily for debugging and critical app functionality (via Expo services), such as:
- Device model and operating system version.
- Crash reports (if the app malfunctions).

**Note:** We have **removed all advertising and third-party behavioral tracking SDKs** from our application. We do not sell your personal data to advertisers.

- **Account Management:** To manage your registration, login, and subscription status.
- **Performance:** To prevent fraud, fix bugs, and optimize app performance.

## 4. Camera and Permissions

The App requests access to your device's **Camera**.
- **Purpose:** The camera is used **solely** for scanning barcodes and QR codes to quickly add products or search for items in your inventory.
- **Privacy:** We do not record, save, or transmit video or images from your camera to any external server. The processing happens locally on your device or instantaneously for the purpose of reading the code.

## 5. Third-Party Services

We use trusted third-party services to operate our infrastructure. These partners have their own privacy policies ensuring data security:

- **Supabase:** We use Supabase as our backend database to store your encrypted user and business data.

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption in transit (SSL/TLS) and secure database storage. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 7. Data Retention and Deletion

- **Retention:** We retain your data as long as your account is active.
